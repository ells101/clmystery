To work this one out, I used cat to add all of the membership text files together intnto one text file, doing so enables me to use the grep command. I then piped and used wc to check how many times a given name appears in a file like so: grep "Erika" masterMem | wc -l This narrowed down my search to Jeremy Bowers and Jacqui Maher. Both people had four membership cards belonging to the suspects membership club.  Both could be the murderer then...however, I know that we are looking for a male so, the killer must be Jeremy Bowers! (Proved in solution)
